This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Create a file in the frontend folder called '.env.local' and double-check that this file is included in your .gitignore. Never commit the .env file to github

2. Paste the environment variables from the discord chat inside your .env file

3. The first time you use this app you may have to run 'npm install' in the console

4. To start the frontend run 'npm start' in the console from the frontend folder. A beter idea is to run 'npm run dev' from the backend folder to start them at the same time. Remember to read the backend README file as well
